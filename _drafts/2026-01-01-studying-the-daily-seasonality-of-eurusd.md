# Studying the EURUSD

While intraday trends and monthly seasonality information on the EURUSD is widely available, it is worthwhile to understand the data better to see if there are intrinsic patterns that can be distilled for further studies to develop a trading strategy. 

In this article, we study the intraday trends of the EURUSD and compare it across the different trading days of the week to spot volatility regimes and daily seasonlity patterns.

## EURUSD Background

EURUSD indicates the amount of USD required to purchase one EUR. The EURUSD is the most traded currency pair globally, and has high liquidity, which enables tighter spreads as well as market depth. It first started trading in Jan 1999, when the EUR was introduced as the common currency for several European countries.
