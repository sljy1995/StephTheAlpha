# Monetising Volatility Risk Premium for AAPL 
Volatility Risk Premium (VRP) refers to the difference between the Implied Volatility (IV), that is forward-looking and derived from option prices, and the Realised Volatility (RV) that is the actual variance that is realised over time (Feunou, 2017). A common observation is that IV is usually larger than RV, which indicates opportunity to capitalise on the premium from the difference between IV and RV, which is the VRP.
