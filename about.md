Passionate about 3 'M's - Markets, Money, and Math. 

Currently a **MSc in Financial Engineering Candidate at the National University of Singapore**, which I enrolled just back in Aug 2025 to pursue my personal interests at a higher level. However, we all know learning can't just be about sitting in a lecture theatre or drowning in papers and books. So the goal really is to put into practice knowledge that i gain through reading and through my education. 

Here, I intend to write about **quantitative trading research**, with a focus on ideas that are **academically grounded but realistically implementable by a retail trader**. It is basically a working journal where I document my projects and thoughts about markets and test ideas.

## What I Write About

*Main areas of interest:*
- **Volatility Analysis**  
  Opportunities to exploit, signal construction, and option-based strategies.

- **Options & derivatives**  
  Short-dated options, delta/vega risk, and realistic risk management.

- **Quant research & backtesting**  
  Translating theory into code, with attention to bias, assumptions, and failure modes.

- **Retail constraints**  
  Position sizing, transaction costs, and margin.

*I hope to extend my projects into:*
- Cryptocurrency
- eFX

I try to be explicit about **limitations, risks, and assumptions**, not just results.

I come from a quantitative background, with the following education:
- BSc(Hons) in Theoretical Physics, University of Edinburgh
- MPhil in Technology Policy, University of Cambridge
- (Ongoing) MSc in Financial Engineering, National University of Singapore

*Programming*

My main programming language is Python, although I do hope to enhance my C++ skills. Most of my programming skills are self-taught, where I invested much of my time in online courses and personal projects that I have implemented at my workplace. I continue to refine and upgrade my skills through projects and studying others' codes.
