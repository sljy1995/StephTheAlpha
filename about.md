## Hi, I’m Steph

I write about **quantitative trading research**, with a focus on ideas that are **academically grounded but realistically implementable by a retail trader**. The goal really is to put into practice knowledge that i gain through reading and through my education. 

This site is a working journal where I basically document my projects on my thoughts about markets and test ideas.

## What I Write About

My main areas of interest include:

- **Volatility Risk Premium (VRP)**  
  Empirical evidence, signal construction, and option-based strategies.

- **Options & derivatives**  
  Short-dated options, delta/vega risk, and realistic risk management.

- **Quant research & backtesting**  
  Translating theory into code, with attention to bias, assumptions, and failure modes.

- **Retail constraints**  
  Position sizing, transaction costs, margin, and what *doesn’t* scale down well from institutional settings.

I try to be explicit about **limitations, risks, and assumptions**, not just results.

## Philosophy

Most quantitative content online either:
- stays purely theoretical, or
- jumps straight to “here’s a strategy” without enough rigor.

My goal is to sit in between:

> **Serious analysis, clearly explained, with an honest assessment of whether an idea is actually tradable.**

If an idea fails, I document *why*.

## Background

I come from a technical background and am particularly interested in:
- stochastic thinking
- probabilistic risk
- bridging academic finance with real-world trading constraints

This site reflects that mindset.
